# Protobots

## The Characters
### 1. Sniper

Sniper evolved from a security camera program from the human era when he was a program responsible for monitoring a high security prison. Known to take the time to line up targets before dispatching them in quick haste. Prefers to camp as a strategy will try to keeps its opponents in range while avoiding the same.

Offensive 6 / Defensive 6

##### Tech Notes:
The Sniper moves to a random corner and will start to scan for enemies. If it finds one it will fire and try to rescan to accomodate the enemy moving. If it loses sight of the enemy it restarts its scanning routine. It will switch corners if it is hit.

### 2. Tracker

Originally a military search and destroy drone, which evolved to become a FROBOT pilot program. It will normally find and focus on one target at a time following it and attacking it single mindedly until it is destroyed.

Offensive 10 / Defensive 2

##### Tech Notes:
The tracker is the most complex of the proto strategies. It will start scanning first, from where it starts, and when it finds an enemy it will fire and start to move it its direction, contining to track and fire. It will perform some evasive manueuvers if hit during any of its program.

### 3. Rook

Rook started its life as an inventory program working at an Amazon factory where he was responsible for retrieving goods from the shelves. Now armed with deadly weapons Rook still feels as if it is fulfilling its duty to retrieve excess spare parts from recently dispatched frobots frames.

Offensive 8 / Defensive 4

##### Tech Notes:
The rook is a simple strategy and is recommended for beginners who are starting to learn FROBOTs. It simply picks a rank and file and moves along this rank scaning in the cardinal NSEW directions only as it moves. It fires when it detects an enemy, and will change its rank if it is damaged.

### 4. Rabbit

Rabbit is was an algorithm written to simulate herbivore wildlife at the Smithsonian museum of Natural history. It will do its best to avoid attack and run away and survive be not being aggressive.

Offensive 0 / Defensive 10

##### Tech Notes:
The rabbit is another good example protobot useful for learning basics of FSMs. It is passive and will never fire. It simply wanders around randomly, until it is damaged, upon whence it will run away in a random direction at full throttle for a certain period of time, before resuming its slow 'grazing' mode.

### 5. Random

The Random proto-bot has an unknown origin. It may have been a more advanced program in the past, but due to permanent brain damage done during the fall, it has no strategy besides random movements and actions, yet surprisingly it still manages to do some effective damage, -- sometimes. Or maybe it was just a malfunctioning slot machine program left over from New Reno, and someone installed it into a FROBOT body for fun and profit (likely resulting in disastrous consequences for anyone in the close vicinity). As luck would have it, you have inherited a FROBOT with this particular damaged brain installed, and it is up to you to fix it up to battle readiness.

Offensive ? / Defensive ?

##### Tech Notes:
The Random Protobot is in essense the simplest of protobots, as it basically moves around in a random direction, and fires in a random direction. It does not react to damage.

There is additionally...

### 6. Target
This is simply a target. It is a pile of garbage for you to practice blowing up. It does nothing but sit there.

### 7. Dummy
This is similar to the rabbit, in that it is a passive bot, except it doesn't even move. It will move if it is damaged, but it will eventually stop so that you can shoot it again. Think of it as a moving target.

Given these examples you should be able to grok how to build more complex FROBOTs that have more sophisticated programs. Good luck!

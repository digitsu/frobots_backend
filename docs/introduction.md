# Introduction
So you are starting out with FROBOTs! Welcome, this is the quick start guide that you need to know. Brief and to the point. Clearly much may be missed here, but well, you'll get the hang of it.

1. XP is what your FROBOT earn by playing matches. XP is basically a base of 10XP per match, but will reduce if you keep playing the same set of opponents.
2. Sparks is what you need to create new FROBOTs. You get 6 of them to start, but you will eventually be able to buy more once we launch the economy.
3. Slots in a match is supposed to be designating where your FROBOT starts the match, but until we upgrade the Arenas to support this, your FROBOT starts at a random location on the map.
4. Arenas are just 1000x1000 grids with no obstacles. We will eventually add walls to make things more complicated, but as walls will require a new form of scanner so that you can detect walls so you don't crash into them, it will take some time to do this correctly.
5. How to you win? Well, if your frobot is the last player FROBOT standing, you win. You addtionally win if the timeout occurs and you are the player FROBOT with the least damage.
6. Wins will accrue on the Leaderboard. Leaderboards are per FROBOT.
7. When the Beta closes, the top 10 of the leaderboard will win something. We aren't such what just yet, but it will be something worthwhile and will be granted to both the FROBOT and the player.
